# README

To meet the challenge requirements, the project, which was initially developed in Django, underwent a complete conversion to Ruby on Rails. This transition ensured that all challenge criteria and specifications were met using the Rails framework and conventions.

1. RUN "bundle install" to install gems;
2. RUN bundle exec rails db:create to created databases (remember to config your database.yml file with your database configs);
3. RUN bundle exec rails db:migrate to created models, indexes and relations;
4. RUN bundle exec rails s to up your server.
5. RUN rails db:seed if you want to create feel records to play with this api :]

To play with this I suggest postman.

Tests

I created automated tests using rspec, please to execute this run "bundle exec rspec".
